# Advice Generator for Uncertain Times of COVID-19

### Initial Purpose

"Random Advice Generator" was the theme for freeCodeCamp Chicago Study Group's online meetup on 03/29/2020. I ultimately chose to set the tone for this project by thinking about what advice I really appreciate these days. These are uncertain times, and COVID-19 has a lot of people around the world dealing with hardships. No amount of advice can truly help someone with the logistics of their difficulties, but it can help those more fortunate to see their privilege during troubling times and hopefully encourage mindfulness.

### Uses

1. I'm making this project for myself because I love to read advice that makes me think more about what I have to appreciate. Going through advice will be very helpful in my mindfulness meditations.
2. I'm also making it so some family and friends could take a look whenever they feel like they need some encouragement or mindfulness too.
3. I have stumbled across random advice on the Internet plenty of times. Someone else probably will stumble upon this eventually and could find even the tiniest moment of thankfulness.
